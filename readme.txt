[+] Description: Page has features like registering and logging, changing the difficulty 
[+]		 of a AI, creating charts by user statistics and generating ranking
[+]		 (using python and python module matplolib)

[+] Website is fully responsive



-*-    PYTHON SETUP    -*-

[+] To setup python functions you have to paste the full python interpreter path
[+] into the variable called 'interpreter_path' in ' PYTHON ' section.

[+] If you don't know where the python interpreter is located
[+] you can type 'where python' in cmd - result is path/paths 
[+] of interpreter (simply copy one and paste
[+] into config)

[+] If you have the python set in the environment you can change the value of 'nev_variable' to 1 
[+] (It's a quick way of executing python commands, default: 0)
[+] If you don't have the python installed - the page will be still alive, but without the user charts
[+] and ranking will be generated by php instead.

[+] Form of connecting python with php is as it looks like (it's not practical, because 
[+] scripts are executing on the client machine), but it's kind of warmup. 
[+] I'm gonna create a server with the python 
[+] interpreter soon if I need that.

[+] Python script 'dir.py' generates
[+] the user own dir in res/charts/
[+] there are being saved user charts (winrate, level variety).



-*-    DATABASE    -*-

[+] Contains two tables: 'user' and 'stats'
[+] 'user' - saves users username and passwords
[+] (username, password)
[+] 'stats' - contains their statistics of a game
[+] (their points, ai points, game level)

[+] Database contains 7 users in 'user' table
[+] Usernames and their passwords are set in the users.txt
[+] in the same directory as this file.



-*-    AI    -*-

[+] AI is set in lib/ directory
[+] It's a 3 level Artificial Inteligence
[+] Amateur, Intermediate, Expert

[+] AMATEUR:
[+] Returns random move 

[+] INTERMEDIATE
[+] Return move against the user move assuming 
[+] that user changes his peek after lose to another

[+] EXPERT
[+] Simple AI is analyzing last user moves
[+] Checks if user is doubling his moves.
[+] Calc the percentage of the most used move.
[+] Checks if user is changing moves in cycle mode.
[+] Returns the most optimal move against user it can predict.
[+] Accuracy is about 60% - 70%
